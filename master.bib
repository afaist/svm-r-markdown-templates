                 in a molecular system directly, rather than indirectly
                 through the agency of energy. This permits an
                 independent calculation of the slope of the curves of
                 energy vs. position of the nuclei, and may thus
                 increase the accuracy, or decrease the labor involved
                 in the calculation of these curves. The force on a
                 nucleus in an atomic system is shown to be just the
                 classical electrostatic force that would be exerted on
                 this nucleus by other nuclei and by the electrons'
                 charge distribution. Qualitative implications of this

                 in a different way. It is, however, mathematically
                 equivalent to the familiar formulation. In quantum
                 mechanics the probability of an event which can happen
                 in several different ways is the absolute square of a
                 sum of complex contributions, one from each alternative
                 way. The probability that a particle will be found to
                 have a path $ x(t) $ lying somewhere within a region of
                 space time is the square of a sum of contributions, one
                 from each path in the region. The contribution from a
                 single path is postulated to be an exponential whose
                 (imaginary) phase is the classical action (in units of
                 $ \hbar $ ) for the path in question. The total
                 contribution from all paths reaching $x$, $t$ from the
                 past is the wave function $ \psi (x, t) $. This is
                 shown to satisfy Schr{\"o}dinger's equation. The
                 relation to matrix and operator algebra is discussed.

  abstract =     "In this paper two things are done. (1) It is shown
                 that a considerable simplification can be attained in
                 writing down matrix elements for complex processes in
                 electrodynamics. Further, a physical point of view is
                 available which permits them to be written down
                 directly for any specific problem. Being simply a
                 restatement of conventional electrodynamics, however,
                 the matrix elements diverge for complex processes. (2)
                 Electrodynamics is modified by altering the interaction
                 of electrons at short distances. All matrix elements
                 are now finite, with the exception of those relating to
                 problems of vacuum polarization. The latter are
                 evaluated in a manner suggested by Pauli and Bethe,
                 which gives finite results for these matrices also. The
                 only effects sensitive to the modification are changes
                 in mass and charge of the electrons. Such changes could
                 not be directly observed. Phenomena directly
                 observable, are insensitive to the details of the
                 modification used (except at extreme energies). For
                 such phenomena, a limit can be taken as the range of
                 the modification goes to zero. The results then agree
                 with those of Schwinger. A complete, unambiguous, and
                 presumably consistent, method is therefore available
                 for the calculation of all processes involving
                 electrons and photons.\par

                 The simplification in writing the expressions results
                 from an emphasis on the over-all space--time view
                 resulting from a study of the solution of the equations
                 of electrodynamics. The relation of this to the more
                 conventional Hamiltonian point of view is discussed. It
                 would be very difficult to make the modification which
                 is proposed if one insisted on having the equations in
                 Hamiltonian form.

                 The methods apply as well to charges obeying the
                 Klein--Gordon equation, and to the various meson
                 theories of nuclear forces. Illustrative examples are
                 given. Although a modification like that used in
                 electrodynamics can make all matrices finite for all of
                 the meson theories, for some of the theories it is no
                 longer true that all directly observable phenomena are
                 insensitive to the details of the modification
                 used.

                 The actual evaluation of integrals appearing in the
                 matrix elements may be facilitated, in the simpler
                 cases, by methods described in the appendix.",

  abstract =     "The problem of the behavior of positrons and electrons
                 in given external potentials, neglecting their mutual
                 interaction, is analyzed by replacing the theory of
                 holes by a reinterpretation of the solutions of the
                 Dirac equation. It is possible to write down a complete
                 solution of the problem in terms of boundary conditions
                 on the wave function, and this solution contains
                 automatically all the possibilities of virtual (and
                 real) pair formation and annihilation together with the
                 ordinary scattering processes, including the correct
                 relative signs of the various terms.\par

                 In this solution, the ``negative energy states'' appear
                 in a form which may be pictured (as by St{\"u}ckelberg)
                 in space--time as waves traveling away from the
                 external potential backwards in time. Experimentally,
                 such a wave corresponds to a positron approaching the
                 potential and annihilating the electron. A particle
                 moving forward in time (electron) in a potential may be
                 scattered forward in time (ordinary scattering) or
                 backward (pair annihilation). When moving backward
                 (positron) it may be scattered backward in time
                 (positron scattering) or forward (pair production). For
                 such a particle the amplitude for transition from an
                 initial to a final state is analyzed to any order in
                 the potential by considering it to undergo a sequence
                 of such scatterings.\par

                 The amplitude for a process involving many such
                 particles is the product of the transition amplitudes
                 for each particle. The exclusion principle requires
                 that antisymmetric combinations of amplitudes be chosen
                 for those complete processes which differ only by
                 exchange of particles. It seems that a consistent
                 interpretation is only possible if the exclusion
                 principle is adopted. The exclusion principle need not
                 be taken into account in intermediate states. Vacuum
                 problems do not arise for charges which do not interact
                 with one another, but these are analyzed nevertheless
                 in anticipation of application to quantum
                 electrodynamics.\par

                 The results are also expressed in momentum--energy
                 variables. Equivalence to the second quantization
                 theory of holes is proved in an appendix.",

                 the solution of problems in quantum electrodynamics is
                 established. Starting with Fermi's formulation of the
                 field as a set of harmonic oscillators, the effect of
                 the oscillators is integrated out in the Lagrangian
                 form of quantum mechanics. There results an expression
                 for the effect of all virtual photons valid to all
                 orders in e2/ c. It is shown that evaluation of this
                 expression as a power series in e2/ c gives just the
                 terms expected by the aforementioned rules.\par

                 In addition, a relation is established between the
                 amplitude for a given process in an arbitrary
                 unquantized potential and in a quantum electrodynamical
                 field. This relation permits a simple general statement

                 parameter analogous to proper time to describe the
                 trajectory of the particle in four dimensions.\par

                 A second Appendix discusses, in the special case of
                 photons, the problem of finding what real processes are

                 order of operation of noncommuting quantities is
                 suggested. Instead of the order being defined by the
                 position on the paper, an ordering subscript is
                 introduced so that $ A_s B_s $ means $ A B $ or $ B A $
                 depending on whether $s$ exceeds $s$ or vice versa.
                 Then $ A_s $ can be handled as though it were an
                 ordinary numerical function of $s$. An increase in ease
                 of manipulating some operator expressions results.
                 Connection to the theory of functionals is discussed in
                 an appendix. Illustrative applications to quantum
                 mechanics are made. In quantum electrodynamics it
                 permits a simple formal understanding of the

                 ordering parameter in this case as a fifth coordinate

  abstract =     "The relativistic corrections to the Lamb shift, i.e.,
                 terms of order $ \alpha (Z \alpha)^5 m c^2 $, are
                 calculated. For this purpose, the Lamb shift is
                 separated into one term in which the Coulomb potential
                 acts only once, and another term in which it acts two
                 or more times (Sec. II). The one-potential term is
                 shown to be equal to the expression calculated in
                 previous papers except for corrections of order $
                 \alpha (Z \alpha)^6 $ (Sec. III), and a method is given
                 by which these corrections could be evaluated if
                 desired (Appendix). The many-potential term can be
                 separated into a nonrelativistic part which is again
                 equal to the term calculated in previous papers, and a
                 relativistic term which can be calculated by
                 considering the intermediate states as free (Sec. IV).
                 The calculation of the latter term which, of course,
                 involves the Coulomb potential exactly twice, is
                 described in Sec. V. A correction to the vacuum
                 polarization term which is of the same order, is
                 evaluated in Sec. VI.\par

                 The result for the relativistic correction is 7.13
                 Mc/sec, and is in agreement with the result of Karplus,
                 Klein, and Schwinger which was obtained by an
                 independent method. The result for the complete Lamb
                 shift has been given in a recent paper by Salpeter. The
                 small remaining discrepancy of 0.6 Mc/sec between
                 theory and experiment might be due to the next order
                 relativistic correction which should be of order $
                 \alpha (Z \alpha)^6 \ln (Z \alpha) $.",

                 temperatures (below $ 0.5^\circ K $ ) are discussed
                 from the atomic point of view. It is argued that the
                 lowest states are compressional waves (phonons).
                 Long-range motions which leave density unaltered
                 (stirrings) are impossible for Bose statistics since
                 they simply permute the atoms. Motions on an atomic
                 scale are possible, but require a minimum energy of
                 excitation. Therefore at low temperature the specific
                 heat varies as $ T^3 $ and the flow resistance of the
                 fluid is small. The arguments are entirely qualitative
                 no calculation of the energy of excitation nor of the
                 low-temperature viscosity is given. In an appendix an
                 expression, previously given, for the partition

                 the large interatomic forces, liquid He$^4$ should
                 exhibit a transition analogous to the transition in an
                 ideal Bose--Einstein gas. The exact partition function
                 is written as an integral over trajectories, using the
                 space--time approach to quantum mechanics. It is next
                 argued that the motion of one atom through the others
                 is not opposed by a potential barrier because the
                 others may move out of the way. This just increases the
                 effective inertia of the moving atom. This permits a
                 simpler form to be written for the partition function.
                 A rough analysis of this form shows the existence of a
                 transition, but of the third order. It is possible that
                 a more complete analysis would show that the transition
                 implied by the simplified partition function is
                 actually like the experimental one.",

  abstract =     "It is argued that the wave function representing an
                 excitation in liquid helium should be nearly of the
                 form $ \sum i f(r_i) \phi $, where $ \phi $ is the
                 ground-state wave function, $ f(r) $ is some function
                 of position, and the sum is taken over each atom $i$.
                 In the variational principle this trial function
                 minimizes the energy if $ f(r) = \exp (i k \cdot r) $,
                 the energy value being $ E(k) = \hbar^2 k^2 / 2 m S(k)
                 $, where $ S(k) $ is the structure factor of the liquid
                 for neutron scattering. For small $k$, $E$ rises
                 linearly (phonons). For larger $k$, $ S(k) $ has a
                 maximum which makes a ring in the diffraction pattern
                 and a minimum in the $ E(k) $ vs $k$ curve. Near the
                 minimum, $ E(k) $ behaves as $ \Delta + \hbar^2 (k -
                 k_0)^2 / 2 \mu $, which form Landau found agrees with
                 the data on specific heat. The theoretical value of $
                 \Delta $ is twice too high, however, indicating need of
                 a better trial function.\par

                 Excitations near the minimum are shown to behave in all
                 essential ways like the rotons postulated by Landau.
                 The thermodynamic and hydrodynamic equations of the
                 two-fluid model are discussed from this view. The view
                 is not adequate to deal with the details of the $
                 \lambda $ transition and with problems of critical flow
                 velocity.\par

                 In a dilute solution of He$^3$ atoms in He$^4$, the
                 He$^3$ should move essentially as free particles but of
                 higher effective mass. This mass is calculated, in an
                 appendix, to be about six atomic mass units.",

  abstract =     "A wave function previously used to represent an
                 excitation (phonon or roton) in liquid helium, inserted
                 into a variational principle for the energy, gave an
                 energy-momentum curve having the qualitative shape
                 suggested by Landau; but the value computed for the
                 minimum energy $ \Delta $ of a roton was 19.1$^\circ
                 $K, while thermodynamic data require $ \Delta =
                 9.6^\circ K $. A new wave function is proposed here.
                 The new value computed for $ \Delta $ is 11.5$^\circ
                 $K. Qualitatively, the wave function suggests that the
                 roton is a kind of quantum-mechanical analog of a
                 microscopic vortex ring, of diameter about equal to the
                 atomic spacing. A forward motion of single atoms
                 through the center of the ring is accompanied by a
                 dipole distribution of returning flow far from the
                 ring.\par

                 In the computation both the two-atom and three-atom
                 correlation functions appear. The former is known from
                 x-rays, while for the latter the Kirkwood approximation
                 of a product of three two-atom correlation functions is
                 used. A method is developed to estimate and correct for
                 most of the error caused by this approximation, so that
                 the residual uncertainty due to this source is
                 negligible.",

                 neutrons scattered from liquid He II would permit a
                 determination of the energy-versus-momentum relation
                 for the elementary excitations (phonons and rotons) in
                 the liquid. A major part of the scattering at a fixed
                 angle arises from production or annihilation of a
                 single excitation and appears as sharp lines in the
                 energy spectrum. From the position of these lines the
                 energy-versus-momentum relation of the excitations can
                 be inferred. Other processes, such as production or
                 annihilation of multiple excitations, contribute a
                 continuous background, and occur at a negligible rate
                 if the incident neutrons are slow ($ \lambda \geq 4
                 {\AA } $ ) and the helium cold ($ T < 2^\circ K $ ).
                 The total cross-section data can be accounted for by

                 Line widths in the discrete spectrum are negligible at
                 $ 1^\circ K $ because of the long lifetime of phonons

  abstract =     "The representation of Fermi particles by two-component
                 Pauli spinors satisfying a second order differential
                 equation and the suggestion that in $ \beta $ decay
                 these spinors act without gradient couplings leads to
                 an essentially unique weak four-fermion coupling. It is
                 equivalent to equal amounts of vector and axial vector
                 coupling with two-component neutrinos and conservation
                 of leptons. (The relative sign is not determined
                 theoretically.) It is taken to be ``universal''; the
                 lifetime of the $ \mu $ agrees to within the
                 experimental errors of 2\%. The vector part of the
                 coupling is, by analogy with electric charge, assumed
                 to be not renormalized by virtual mesons. This
                 requires, for example, that pions are also ``charged''
                 in the sense that there is a direct interaction in
                 which, say, a $ \pi^0 $ goes to $ \pi^- $ and an
                 electron goes to a neutrino. The weak decays of strange
                 particles will result qualitatively if the universality
                 is extended to include a coupling involving a $ \Lambda
                 $ or $ \Sigma $ fermion. Parity is then not conserved
                 even for those decays like $ K \to 2 \pi $ or $ 3 \pi $
                 which involve no neutrinos. The theory is at variance
                 with the measured angular correlation of electron and
                 neutrino in He$^6$, and with the fact that fewer than $
                 10^{-4} $ pion decay into electron and neutrino.",

  abstract =     "We have obtained an approximate expression for the
                 impedance function at all frequencies, temperatures,
                 and coupling strengths of an electron coupled to a
                 polar lattice (a system commonly called a polaron). The
                 starting point for the calculation is the quantum
                 mechanical expression for the expected current. The
                 phonon coordinates are eliminated from this expression
                 by well-known field-theory techniques. The resulting
                 exact ``influence functional'' is then approximated by
                 a corresponding quadratic ``influence functional'
                 which, it is hoped, imitates the real polaron.
                 Correction terms are computed to account for the
                 difference between the approximate impedance and the
                 exact polaron impedance in a manner closely analogous
                 to Feynman's treatment of the polaron self-energy. In
                 fact, the analytic evaluation of the expression for the
                 impedance obtained here is carried out using the
                 approximate ``influence functional'' that was
                 successfully employed in minimizing the binding (and
                 free) energy of the polaron in earlier calculations.
                 However, the accuracy obtained using this
                 approximation, for the impedance calculation, is less
                 satisfactory and its limitations are discussed.
                 Nevertheless, beginning at intermediate coupling
                 strengths, the approximate impedance produces a level
                 structure of increasing complexity and narrowing
                 resonances as the coupling strengthens. This suggests
                 that further refinements may be fruitful. Methods for
                 finding a better quadratic influence functional for use
                 in our impedance expression as well as ways of
                 improving the expression further are suggested. A
                 comparison of our results with those of the Boltzmann
                 equation points up interesting differences which arise
                 from reversing the order of taking limits of zero
                 frequency and coupling.",

  abstract =     "We have a habit in writing articles published in
                 scientific journals to make the work as finished as
                 possible, to cover up all the tracks, to not worry
                 about the blind alleys or to describe how you had the
                 wrong idea first, and so on. So there isn't any place
                 to publish, in a dignified manner, what you actually
                 did in order to get to do the work although there has
                 been in these days some interest in this kind of thing.
                 Since winning the prize is a personal thing, I thought
                 I could be excused in this particular situation if I
                 were to talk personally about my relationship to
                 quantum electrodynamics, rather than to discuss the
                 subject itself in a refined and finished fashion.
                 Furthermore, since there are three people who have won
                 the prize in physics, if they are all going to be
                 talking about quantum electrodynamics itself, one might
                 become bored with the subject. So what I would like to
                 tell you about today is the sequence of events, really
                 the sequence of ideas, which occurred, and by which I
                 finally came out the other end with an unsolved problem
                 for which I ultimately received a prize",

  abstract =     "The expectation value of the steady-state velocity
                 acquired by an electron interacting with the
                 longitudinal, optical phonons of a polar crystal in a
                 finite electric field is analyzed quantum mechanically
                 for arbitrary coupling strength, field strength, and
                 temperature. The rate of loss of momentum by an
                 electron drifting through the crystal in the applied
                 field is expressed in a form in which the lattice
                 coordinates (the phonons) have been eliminated exactly
                 by path-integral methods. This expression is then
                 evaluated by a path-integral approach similar to that
                 used to calculate the impedance of electrons in polar
                 crystals. We present numerical calculations of field
                 (loss of energy per unit distance) versus velocity for
                 three coupling strengths using the Fr{\"o}hlich polaron
                 model. In a single curve, all the expected phenomena
                 appear, including a threshold field for producing hot
                 electrons and a decreasing rate of energy loss with
                 velocity for very fast electrons. Using only the
                 experimentally measured values of the reststrahlen
                 energy and the static and optical dielectric constants,
                 we find an energy loss of 0.025 eV/{\AA} for electrons
                 near the threshold in Al$_2$O$_3$, which compares

                 eV/{\AA}. We conclude that optical-phonon scattering

  abstract =     "A relativistic equation to represent the symmetric
                 quark model of hadrons with harmonic interaction is
                 used to define and calculate matrix elements of vector
                 and axial-vector currents. Elements between states with
                 large mass differences are too big compared to
                 experiment, so a factor whose functional form involves
                 one arbitrary constant is introduced to compensate
                 this. The vector elements are compared with experiments
                 on photoelectric meson production, $ K_\beta $ decay,
                 and $ \omega \to \pi \gamma $. Pseudoscalar-meson decay
                 widths of hadrons are calculated supposing the
                 amplitude is proportional (with one new scale constant)
                 to the divergence of the axial-vector current matrix
                 elements. Starting only from these two constants, the
                 slope of the Regge trajectories, and the masses of the
                 particles, 75 matrix elements are calculated, of which
                 more than 3/4 agree with the experimental values within
                 40\%. The problems of extending this calculational
                 scheme to a viable physical theory are discussed.",

  abstract =     "We investigate the consequences of the assumption that
                 the high-transverse-momentum particles seen in
                 hadron-hadron collisions are produced by a single,
                 hard, large-angle elastic scattering of quarks, one
                 from the target and one from the beam. The fast
                 outgoing quarks are assumed to fragment into a cascade
                 jet of hadrons. The distributions of quarks in the
                 incoming hadrons are determined from lepton--hadron
                 inelastic scattering data, together with certain
                 theoretical constraints such as sum rules, etc. The
                 manner in which quarks cascade into hadrons is
                 determined from particle distributions seen in
                 lepton--hadron and lepton--lepton collisions
                 supplemented by theoretical arguments. The quark
                 elastic scattering cross section is parametrized in a
                 purely phenomenological way and the choice $ d \sigma /
                 d t = 2.3 \times 10^6 / ( - s t^3) \mu b \mathrm
                 {GeV}^_6 $ gives a reasonable fit to all the data for
                 hadron + hadron meson + anything for $ p_\perp \geq 2
                 \mathrm {GeV} / c $. Many predictions do not depend
                 sensitively on the exact form for $ d \sigma / d t $
                 and therefore test our basic assumption. The data
                 examined include single-particle production in pp
                 collisions at various energies and angles. Particle
                 ratios ($ \pi^+ $, $ \pi^- $, $ K^+ $, $ K^- $, and $
                 \eta $ ) are predicted and discussed. In addition, the
                 ratio of production of $ \pi^0 $'s by beams of $ \pi^+
                 $ and protons on a proton target is explained. With
                 this model we have found no serious inconsistency with
                 data, but several predictions for charge ratios and
                 beam ratios at other angles are presented that have yet
                 to be tested experimentally.",

  abstract =     "It is shown that if, in a calculation of
                 high-transverse-momentum (p ) meson production in
                 hadron-hadron collisions, one includes not only the
                 scale-breaking effects that might be expected from
                 asymptotically free theories but also the effects due
                 to the transverse momentum of quarks in hadrons and
                 further adds contributions from quark-gluon and
                 gluon-gluon scattering to those of quark-quark
                 scattering then the results are not inconsistent with
                 the data. The approach yields the correct magnitude and
                 an apparent approximate $ 1 / p_\perp^8 $ behavior in
                 accord with single-particle data for the energy range
                 currently observed. Two-particle correlations are
                 examined. Because of scale-breaking effects and the
                 presence of gluons, the theory does not have the
                 problem of predicting too many away-side hadrons at
                 large $ p_\perp $ as did an earlier quark-quark
                 scattering ``black-box'' approach. We conclude that the
                 quantum-chromodynamics approach is in reasonable accord
                 with the data although theoretical uncertainties
                 (especially at low $ p_\perp $ ) make incontrovertible
                 conclusions impossible at present. Crucial tests of the
                 theory require higher $ p_\perp $ than are now
                 available; estimates for this region are made.",

                 making silicon micromotors, the use of electrostatic
                 actuation, and the importance of friction and contact
                 sticking in such devices. The persistent problem of
                 finding meaningful applications for these tiny machines
                 is discussed, touching a range of topics along the way.
                 The future of computation using a register made of
                 atoms, and quantum-mechanical transitions for
                 computation operations, is looked at.",

                 professionals alike. That text was based on
                 transcriptions of the hundreds of hours of audio
                 recordings made during Feynman's legendary classroom
                 lectures. Now, for the first time on compact disc, the
                 best of these recordings are available in digitally
                 mastered quality. Ranging from the most basic
                 principles of Newtonian physics through such formidable
                 topics as Einstein's general relativity,
                 superconductivity, and quantum mechanics, Feynman's
                 lectures stand as a monument of clear exposition and
                 deep insight. Timeless and collectible, these
                 unabridged lectures are essential listening, not just
                 for students of physics, but for anyone seeking an
                 introduction to the field from the inimitable Richard

                 be the best introductory set of lectures on physics
                 ever written. Feynman himself, however, stated in his
                 original preface that he was ``pessimistic'' with
                 regard to the success with which he reached all of his
                 students. The Feynman lectures were written ``to
                 maintain the interest of very enthusiastic and rather
                 smart students coming out of high schools and into Cal
                 Tech.'' Feynman was targeting the lectures to students
                 who, ``at the end of two years of our previous course,
                 [were] very discouraged because there were really very
                 few grand, new, modern ideas presented to them.'' As a
                 result, some physics students find the lectures more
                 valuable after they obtain a good grasp of physics by
                 studying more traditional texts. Many professional
                 physicists refer to the lectures at various points in
                 their careers to refresh their minds with regard to
                 basic principles.",

  abstract =     "From astrophysics to condensed matter theory, nearly
                 all of modern physics employs the path integral
                 technique. In this presentation, the developer of path
                 integrals and one of the best-known scientists of all
                 time, Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard P. Feynman,
                 presents unique insights into this method and its
                 applications. Avoiding dense, complicated descriptions,
                 Feynman articulates his celebrated theory in a clear,
                 concise manner, maintaining a perfect balance between
                 mathematics and physics. This emended edition of the
                 original 1965 publication corrects hundreds of
                 typographical errors and recasts many equations for
                 clearer comprehension. It retains the original's verve
                 and spirit, and it is approved and endorsed by the
                 Feynman family. The opening chapters explore the
                 fundamental concepts of quantum mechanics and introduce
                 path integrals. Subsequent chapters cover more advanced
                 topics, including the perturbation method, quantum
                 electrodynamics, and the relation of path integrals to
                 statistical mechanics. In addition to its merit as a
                 text for graduate courses in physics, this volume
                 serves as an excellent resource for professionals.",

  abstract =     "Celebrated for his brilliantly quirky insights into
                 the physical world, Nobel laureate Richard Feynman also
                 possessed an extraordinary talent for explaining
                 difficult concepts to the general public. Here Feynman
                 provides a classic and definitive introduction to QED
                 (namely quantum electrodynamics), that part of quantum
                 field theory describing the interactions of light with
                 charged particles. Using everyday language, spatial
                 concepts, visualizations, and his renowned ``Feynman
                 diagrams'' instead of advanced mathematics, Feynman
                 clearly and humorously communicates both the substance
                 and spirit.",

  abstract =     "One of the towering figures of twentieth-century
                 science, Richard Feynman possessed a curiosity that was
                 the stuff of legend. Even before he won the Nobel Prize
                 in 1965, his unorthodox and spellbinding lectures on
                 physics secured his reputation amongst students and
                 seekers around the world. It was his outsized love for
                 life, however, that earned him the status of an
                 American cultural icon--here was an extraordinary
                 intellect devoted to the proposition that the thrill of
                 discovery was matched only by the joy of communicating
                 it to others. In this career-spanning collection of
                 letters, many published here for the first time, we are
                 able to see this side of Feynman like never before. As
                 edited and annotated by his daughter, Michelle, these
                 letters not only allow us to better grasp the how and
                 why of Feynman's enduring appeal, but also to see the
                 virtues of an inquiring eye in spectacular fashion. The
                 result is a wonderful de facto guide to life, an
                 eloquent testimony to the human quest for knowledge at
                 all levels.",

                 learnt much more from Bethe, but I think if I stayed
                 here much longer I should begin to find that it was
                 Feynman with whom I was working more.''",
  remark-2 =     "From page 37, in a letter of 1 November 1948: ``In the
                 evening I mentioned that there were just two problems
                 for which the finiteness of the theory remained to be
                 established; both problems are well-known and feared by
                 physicists, since many long and difficult papers
                 running to 50 pages and more have been written about
                 them, trying unsuccessfully to make the older theories
                 give sensible answers to them. Amongst others,
                 [Nicholas] Kemmer and the great [Werner] Heisenberg had
                 been baffled by these problems.\par

                 When I mentioned this fact, Feynman said, `We'll see
                 about this,' and proceeded to sit down and in two
                 hours, before our eyes, obtain finite and sensible
                 answers to both problems. It was the most amazing piece
                 of lightning calculation I have ever witnessed, and the
                 results prove, apart from some unforeseen complication,
                 the consistency of the whole theory.\par

                 The two problems were, the scattering of light by an
                 electric field, and the scattering of light by light.
                 After supper Feynman was working until 3 am.''",
  remark-3 =     "From page 37, in a letter of 28 February 1949: ``The
                 trouble with him [Richard Feynman], of course, is that
                 he never will publish what he does; I sometimes feel a
                 little guilty for having cut in in front of him with
                 his own ideas. However, he is now at last writing up
                 two big papers, which will display his genius to the
                 world.''",

                 of nature in their simplest and most general terms. It
                 begins in Part 1 with a detailed discussion of
                 transformation theory, which is used by the author to
                 formulate advanced quantum theory in group-theoretical
                 language. Part 2 deals with scattering theory and
                 includes many applications to nuclear, atomic, and
                 solid-state physics. The central theme of the book,
                 however, is presented in Part 3: relativistic Feynman
                 diagrams. The student learns to use them in a most
                 natural way and will find a thorough discussion of the
                 lowest-order electromagnetic, strong, weak, and
                 gravitational interactions. The last chapter deals with
                 the finite parts of higher-order graphs in field theory
                 and dispersion theory. In the second edition errors
                 have been eliminated and the text has been enhanced
                 with the inclusion of new sections on the quark
                 model.",

                 non-relativistic time-sliced Feynman path integral into
                 perturbation expansions. These methods reveal that when
                 the time interval is sliced into N increments, each
                 order of perturbation theory sustains an error O(1/
                 square root N). In this way the author provides exact
                 path integral results for the following potentials:
                 delta-function comb, finite well, tunnelling barrier,
                 and a generalized exponential cusp. For the tunnelling
                 barrier it is seen how the celebrated (-1) reflection
                 factor arises in the limit of infinite barrier height.
                 The one-dimensional Coulomb problem is solved as a
                 limiting case of the exponential cusp. In addition, for
                 power potentials the author indicates how this path
                 integral approach yields sometimes divergent,
                 nevertheless asymptotic perturbation expansions.",

  abstract =     "This author provides an easily accessible introduction
                 to quantum field theory via Feynman rules and
                 calculations in particle physics. His aim is to make
                 clear what the physical foundations of present-day
                 field theory are, to clarify the physical content of
                 Feynman rules. The book begins with a brief review of
                 some aspects of Einstein's theory of relativity that
                 are of particular importance for field theory, before
                 going on to consider the relativistic quantum mechanics
                 of free particles, interacting fields, and particles
                 with spin. The techniques learnt in the chapters are
                 then demonstrated in examples that might be encountered
                 in real accelerator physics. Further chapters contain
                 discussions of renormalization, massive and massless
                 vector fields and unitarity. A final chapter presents
                 concluding arguments concerning quantum
                 electrodynamics. The book includes valuable appendices
                 that review some essential mathematics, including
                 complex spaces, matrices, the CBH equation, traces and
                 dimensional regularization. An appendix containing a
                 comprehensive summary of the rules and conventions used
                 is followed by an appendix specifying the full
                 Lagrangian of the Standard Model and the corresponding
                 Feynman rules. To make the book useful for a wide
                 audience a final appendix provides a discussion of the
                 metric used, and an easy-to-use dictionary connecting
                 equations written with different metrics. Written as a
                 textbook, many diagrams, exercises and examples are
                 included. This book will be used by beginning graduate
                 students taking courses in particle physics or quantum
                 field theory, as well as by researchers as a source and
                 reference book on Feynman diagrams and rules.",

                 then, in German? Bethe: Yes. Goodstein: And the others
                 as well? Bethe: The others as well. And they all spoke
                 German very well. Except Mrs. Fermi. When I was invited
                 to the Fermi's home, we spoke English. She spoke
                 English but not German.''",

                 quite obvious that it was not benign. Did you ever
                 encounter [Ettore] Majorana? Bethe: I encountered him;
                 and again, it was almost the same as with Corbino.
                 Well, I guess we talked a little longer, about a half
                 an hour or so. But Majorana at that time did not speak
                 either German or English. But Segr{\'e} was present as
                 an interpreter. Segr{\'e} very much was Majorana's
                 connection to the world, as far as I could make out.
                 Goodstein: Not Rasetti, but Segr{\'e}? Bethe:
                 Segr{\'e}.''",
  remark-3 =     "From page 269: ``Bethe: \ldots{} I would say, even
                 considering the short life of Majorana, Fermi was the
                 greater physicist. But Majorana was very good, there's
                 no question.''",
  remark-4 =     "From page 271: ``Bethe: Feynman was a terrible loss
                 [by Cornell to Caltech]. And a loss that we did not
                 expect. After all, he had done his most fundamental
                 work at Cornell. And we thought that he was quite
                 happy. He said he had too much work with students. But
                 then that was his own fault, in the sense that he was
                 willing to accept far too many PhD students. He didn't
                 need to. There were other professors. So we certainly
                 lost one of the great theoretical physicists in the
                 country, and our department never was the same after
                 that.''",

                 introduction to how knot theory and Feynman diagrams
                 can be used to illuminate problems in quantum field
                 theory. Beginning with a summary of key ideas from
                 perturbative quantum field theory and an introduction
                 to the Hopf algebra structure of renormalization, early
                 chapters discuss the rationality of ladder diagrams and
                 simple link diagrams. The necessary basics of knot
                 theory are then presented and the number theoretic
                 relationship between the topology of Feynman diagrams
                 and knot theory is explored. Later chapters discuss
                 four-term relations motivated by the discovery of
                 Vassiliev invariants in knot theory and draw a link to
                 algebraic structures recently observed in
                 non-commutative geometry. Detailed references are
                 included. Dealing with material at perhaps the most
                 productive interface between mathematics and physics,
                 the book will not only be of considerable interest to
                 theoretical and particle physicists, but also to many
                 mathematicians.",

                 said that he took up science precisely as an
                 alternative to the merely personal. In fact there is no

                 represents much of his work over the past ten years.''.

                 from an attempt to explain the quantum theory through
                 the use of Tom Stoppard's play Hapgood, to a critical
                 review of recent books on Einstein. They describe Mr.

                 grandparent or a football coach, a boss, or a cleric.
                 For a young physicist struggling to find his place in
                 the world, the relationship that would most profoundly
                 influence his life was with his mentor, the Nobel
                 Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman. Shares
                 Feynman's provocative answers to such questions as
                 ``What is the nature of creativity?'' --- And ``How
                 does a scientist think?'' At once a moving portrait of
                 a friendship and an affecting account of Feynman's
                 final, creative years, celebrates the inspiring legacy
                 of one of the greatest thinkers of our time.

                 after-dinner speech, {\em There's plenty of room at the
                 bottom}, which was given by him on December 29, 1959,
                 to be the birthday of theoretical nanotechnology. This
                 attribution is misleading because there is no direct
                 link from Feynman's talk to today's micromachines. We
                 discuss the historical background of Feynman's talk,
                 the state of the art in 1959, and Feynman's motivation.
                 We conclude that Feynman was not interested in building
                 miniaturized versions of existing macroscopic machines,
                 but wished to construct microbiological machines and
                 tools that would enable scientists to mimic
                 microbiological materials.",

  abstract =     "This book presents recent and ongoing research work
                 aimed at understanding the mysterious relation between
                 the computations of Feynman integrals in perturbative
                 quantum field theory and the theory of motives of
                 algebraic varieties and their periods. One of the main
                 questions in the field is understanding when the
                 residues of Feynman integrals in perturbative quantum
                 field theory evaluate to periods of mixed Tate motives.
                 The question originates from the occurrence of multiple
                 zeta values in Feynman integrals calculations observed
                 by Broadhurst and Kreimer. Two different approaches to
                 the subject are described. The first, a ``bottom-up''
                 approach, constructs explicit algebraic varieties and
                 periods from Feynman graphs and parametric Feynman
                 integrals. This approach, which grew out of work of
                 Bloch-Esnault-Kreimer and was more recently developed
                 in joint work of Paolo Aluffi and the author, leads to
                 algebro-geometric and motivic versions of the Feynman
                 rules of quantum field theory and concentrates on
                 explicit constructions of motives and classes in the
                 Grothendieck ring of varieties associated to Feynman
                 integrals. While the varieties obtained in this way can
                 be arbitrarily complicated as motives, the part of the
                 cohomology that is involved in the Feynman integral
                 computation might still be of the special mixed Tate
                 kind. A second, ``top-down'' approach to the problem,
                 developed in the work of Alain Connes and the author,
                 consists of comparing a Tannakian category constructed
                 out of the data of renormalization of perturbative
                 scalar field theories, obtained in the form of a
                 Riemann-Hilbert correspondence, with Tannakian
                 categories of mixed Tate motives. The book draws
                 connections between these two approaches and gives an
                 overview of other ongoing directions of research in the
                 field, outlining the many connections of perturbative
                 quantum field theory and renormalization to motives,
                 singularity theory, Hodge structures, arithmetic
                 geometry, supermanifolds, algebraic and non-commutative
                 geometry. The text is aimed at researchers in
                 mathematical physics, high energy physics, number
                 theory and algebraic geometry. Partly based on lecture
                 notes for a graduate course given by the author at
                 Caltech in the fall of 2008, it can also be used by
                 graduate students interested in working in this area.",

                 of the essential elements of quantum mechanics, solid
                 state physics and statistical mechanics. Alongside a
                 detailed account of the method of second quantization,
                 the book covers topics such as Green's and correlation
                 functions, diagrammatic techniques, superconductivity
                 and contains several case studies. Some background
                 knowledge in quantum mechanics, solid state physics and
                 mathematical methods of physics is assumed. Detailed
                 derivations of formulas and in-depth examples and
                 chapter exercises from various areas of condensed
                 matter physics make this a valuable resource for both

  abstract =     "Energy is at the heart of physics and of huge
                 importance to society and yet no book exists
                 specifically to explain it, and in simple terms. In
                 tracking the history of energy, this book is filled
                 with the thrill of the chase, the mystery of smoke and
                 mirrors, and presents a fascinating human-interest
                 story. Moreover, following the history provides a
                 crucial aid to understanding: this book explains the
                 intellectual revolutions required to comprehend energy,
                 revolutions as profound as those stemming from
                 Relativity and Quantum Theory. Texts by Descartes,
                 Leibniz, Bernoulli, d'Alembert, Lagrange, Hamilton,
                 Boltzmann, Clausius, Carnot and others are made
                 accessible, and the engines of Watt and Joule are
                 explained. Many fascinating questions are covered,
                 including: --- Why just kinetic and potential energies
                 is one more fundamental than the other? --- What are
                 heat, temperature and action? --- What is the
                 Hamiltonian? --- What have engines to do with physics?
                 Why did the steam-engine evolve only in England? ---
                 Why S=klogW works and why temperature is IT. Using only
                 a minimum of mathematics, this book explains the
                 emergence of the modern concept of energy, in all its
                 forms: Hamilton's mechanics and how it shaped
                 twentieth-century physics, and the meaning of kinetic
                 energy, potential energy, temperature, action, and
                 entropy. It is as much an explanation of fundamental
                 physics as a history of the fascinating discoveries
                 that lie behind our knowledge today.",

                 introductory course on theoretical particle physics
                 with the aim of filling the gap that exists between
                 basic courses of classical and quantum mechanics and
                 advanced courses of (relativistic) quantum mechanics
                 and field theory. After a concise but comprehensive
                 introduction to special relativity, key aspects of
                 relativistic dynamics are covered and some elementary
                 concepts of general relativity introduced. Basics of
                 the theory of groups and Lie algebras are explained,
                 with discussion of the group of rotations and the
                 Lorentz and Poincar{\'e} groups. In addition, a concise
                 account of representation theory and of tensor calculus
                 is provided. Quantization of the electromagnetic field
                 in the radiation range is fully discussed. The
                 essentials of the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian formalisms
                 are reviewed, proceeding from systems with a finite
                 number of degrees of freedom and extending the
                 discussion to fields. The final four chapters are
                 devoted to development of the quantum field theory,
                 ultimately introducing the graphical description of
                 interaction processes by means of Feynman diagrams. The
                 book will be of value for students seeking to
                 understand the main concepts that form the basis of
                 contemporary theoretical particle physics and also for
                 engineers and lecturers. An Appendix on some special
                 relativity effects is added.",

                 Physics of Wall Street}, was a New York Times
                 best-seller and named one of \booktitle{Physics
                 Today}'s five most intriguing books of 2013. In his
                 newest volume, he takes on a fundamental concept of
                 modern physics: nothing. The physics of stuff ---
                 protons, neutrons, electrons, and even quarks and
                 gluons --- is at least somewhat familiar to most of us.
                 But what about the physics of nothing? Isaac Newton
                 thought of empty space as nothingness extended in all
                 directions, a kind of theater in which physics could
                 unfold. But both quantum theory and relativity tell us
                 that Newton's picture can't be right. Nothing, it turns
                 out, is an awful lot like something, with a structure
                 and properties every bit as complex and mysterious as
                 matter. In his signature lively prose, Weatherall
                 explores the very nature of empty space --- and
                 solidifies his reputation as a science writer to
                 watch.",

                 Plenty of Room at the Bottom} and \booktitle{Simulating
